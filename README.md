# LocalShop Â©2021 

## Description
Local retail is extremely vital for sustaining smaller communities.  Small businesses may create their own websites and social media but there is no guarantee they will rank on major search engines.  Early business promotion may create large expenses that could otherwise be spent on something else.  Location based searches on Google does help but why not have all small retail products and services saved in one place?  LocalShop displays a business summary page for customers.
